  <p>The following images are from a final project, during the Fall 2021 semester, where my team and I had to pick a restuarant change that was suffering financially due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our job was to give this restuarant a fresh image, promote them, and build/design a mockup website for said business.</p>
