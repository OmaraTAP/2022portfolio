<h3>Ice Rebranded</h3>

  <p>The following images are from a final project, during the Fall 2020 semester, that consisted of completely redesigning the label and logo of any drink of our choice. My brand of choice was ICE.</p>

  <p>For the logo, I wanted a more direct approach by implementing an image of actual ice and some air bubbles. I wanted to keep the text "sparkling", but make it more colorful due to the fact that this brand is known for having a variety of different flavored drinks in different colors. I started with a very rough sketch and then made great use of Adobe Photoshop.</p>

  <p>For the label, I decided that I wanted to keep the classic clear background, but once more, I wanted to go at a more direct appraoch. Due to this being a type of soda, I wanted to add some bubbles that would look like they are floating to the top - all the fizz that rises after opening a new soda bottle. I also wanted to implement another way of showing the type of flavor it is, so I added real fruit to be floating around with the fizz. Once more, I made great use of Adobe Photoshop but also Adobe InDesign to set everything up.</p>
